          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h4>(juh-SAWN) ∇ She/They</h4>
          <p class="about-text">
            Hello! Thanks for dropping in to check out a little more about me. <br><br>

            Ever since I was a tiny human, I have been a creator, first learning to hold a pencil when I was two. I have photos at my grandma's house of me drawing at the table, drawing under the table, and being caught in corners drawing. It's part of who I am, and it's what I LOVE to do. I can usually be found at my desk creating something new or revising something old.<br><br>

            If I'm not working on art, you can find me in the forests, parks, or wherever green things grow. Nature exploration is my other life passion. Standing on the edge of a cliff, feeling the cool wind across my skin, and taking in the beauty of the wondrous pacific northwest I call home.<br><br>

            Currently, my main jam is tattooing at <a href="https://www.bitterroottattoo.com/the-studio" target="_blank">Bitterroot Tattoo</a> in Moscow, Idaho.<br><br>

            My primary mediums are watercolor and ink, but I also enjoy working with acrylic, oil, and digital art. All the mediums have different things that lend themselves better to different tasks.<br><br>


            I have 2 beloved fur babies, Merlin and Kiki. I lost my best friend Jack in January of 2022. You can see him in a couple of different pieces I&#39;ve made. We miss him every day. Keeping a roof over my kitties&#39; heads, a house full of toys, plenty of catnip, and food in their bellies is what keeps me waking up every day and working.<br><br>


            If you're into witchy things, such as tarot, full moon celebrations, solstice gatherings, making good food, and having small gatherings, we will be fast friends.<br><br> 

            I am attempting slow and mindful living. I have stopped living in the fast-paced, rush-to-work, rush-home world. I spend more time in the studio creating, and it is such a privilege to do so. Finding joy in the small and mundane tasks of life has increased my happiness immensely.<br><br>

            I want to contribute more to the community, someday to have a non-profit community arts center, providing valuable resources to young children and folks who are just re-discovering their love of making.<br><br></p>

            <p><span>Thanks for reading! Hoping to connect and make art with you and for you soon!</span></p>
